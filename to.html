                                    Max Forrester had always considered himself
                                    an unremarkable man. At thirty-two, he lived
                                    alone in a modest apartment, worked as a
                                    history professor at the local community
                                    college, and spent most of his free time
                                    buried in books about ancient civilizations.
                                    His colleagues often joked that he knew more
                                    about people who had been dead for centuries
                                    than those currently alive. They weren't
                                    entirely wrong.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It was on a rainy Tuesday afternoon when
                                    Max's life changed forever. He had been
                                    browsing through a small antique shop that
                                    had recently opened on the corner of his
                                    street. The shop was cluttered with dusty
                                    artifacts, forgotten treasures, and items
                                    whose origins were lost to time. The air
                                    smelled of old paper and polished wood.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "Can I help you find anything specific?"
                                    asked the shopkeeper, an elderly woman with
                                    silver hair and eyes that seemed to hold
                                    secrets of their own.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "Just looking," Max replied, his attention
                                    already captured by something in the corner
                                    of the room.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It was a mirror, unlike any he had seen
                                    before. The frame was made of dark wood,
                                    intricately carved with symbols he didn't
                                    recognize—and as a historian, that was
                                    unusual. The glass itself seemed to shimmer
                                    slightly, even in the dim light of the shop.
                                    Max approached it cautiously, drawn by an
                                    inexplicable pull.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "Ah, you have good taste," the shopkeeper
                                    said, appearing beside him. "That piece is
                                    quite special. They say it once belonged to
                                    an alchemist who claimed it showed more than
                                    just reflections."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Max smiled politely at what he assumed was a
                                    sales pitch. "It's beautiful craftsmanship.
                                    How much?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The price was surprisingly reasonable,
                                    almost suspiciously so for such an elaborate
                                    piece. Before he could reconsider, Max found
                                    himself carrying the mirror back to his
                                    apartment, struggling against the rain and
                                    wind as if nature itself was trying to
                                    prevent him from taking it home.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That night, as thunder crashed outside his
                                    window, Max hung the mirror on the wall of
                                    his study. For a moment, he stood before it,
                                    examining his reflection. Nothing seemed
                                    unusual—just the same tired eyes, the same
                                    disheveled brown hair, the same unremarkable
                                    Max Forrester.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He turned away to prepare for bed, unaware
                                    that behind him, the surface of the mirror
                                    rippled like water disturbed by a gentle
                                    breeze. By morning, his world would never be
                                    the same again.
                                </p>
                            </div>
